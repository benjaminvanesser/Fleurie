# Fleurie
Fleurie is a real-time composition system which guides up to 4  participating musicians by proposing playing techniques, dynamics, pitches, note density levels, etc. Apart from acoustic guidance, Fleurie's progression also generates electronic effects based on the pointer positions within Fleurie's playing field. Apart from automating the movement of the pointers (dynamic mode or trigger next position), Fleurie also allows for electronic performers to guide their acoustic colleagues, putting them in the guise of conductors.

1 player quick start

- activate/config audio input & output
- activate pointer 1
- set mode to dynamic (next to pointer state)
- hit play and start playing your instrument

settings

Fleurie allows for a variety of settings: 

Nodes: change state (active/inactive), mode (static/dynamic; i.e. move by itself), size, position in playing field, performance description, assigned effect.

Breakout nodes: go to separate window with nodes (comes in handy when using a secondary screen for the players; option to full screen).

Effect settings: all settings for the effects, including state (on/off), effect parameters, panning, volume, pointer control, trigger probability. Effects can be setup to be automated or performed live.

Pointers: breakout access to 4 pointers.

MIDI/KEY map: map Fleurie's parameters to a MIDI controller

hint: hover cursor over interface elements to reveal tooltips
